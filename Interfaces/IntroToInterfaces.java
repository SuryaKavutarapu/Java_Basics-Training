/**
 *   ## interfaces
 * 
 *   interfaces is a pure abstract class
 *   interface contaians only  public abstract methods and we have to declare those as public
 *   interface containes only public static final variable only 
 *   interface dosen't have Constructors and Objects
 *   interface has refernce variables 
 *     Ex :
 *       InterfaceExample IE ;
 * 
 *   ##interface containes only public static final variable only 
 *   ##in case if  we declare just 
 *     
 *    int a;
 * 
 *    compiler by default declares them  as    public static final 
 * 
 *    public static final  declared varibles & methods are called Global Constants
 *   
 *  
 *    interface doesn't extend it only implements
 *   
 *   
 *   Ex: 
 *  
 *   Class A implements V{
 *  
 *   } 
 * 
 *
